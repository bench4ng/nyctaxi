# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Presentation
  
* What's the Problem? Why is it significant?
* Exploratory Analysis (Panda)
* Clustering (Density of Traffic)
* Regression (Fare, Tip predictions)
* Visualizations (Most Used Routes, Cluster Densities)
* Time-Series (Picking a location and analyzing its traffic over a period of time)
* Big Data (Run-Time, Accuracy stats, AWS)
* Conclusion




## Done

* Clustering codes running
* Regression codes running
* Visualizations template running
* Exploration part done
* * Fare prediction using regression (Accuracy, Stats)
* Clustering and traffic densitie (Optimal k, error, stats)
* Data input for visualization
* Modifying visualization template to fit the data
* Time-series part (Taking a location and analysis of its traffic, visualization for the same)
* Picking most used routes and fitting visualization for the same
* Running Clustering/Regression on AWS and producing stats
